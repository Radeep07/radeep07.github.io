## Portfolio

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, I would likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application. This is why I stated working on 'Responsive Protfolio' which is cosidered to be an extension to my deployed portfolio design.


## Plan for the go!

First, I shall use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to recreate my portfolio. As usual, here are some insights!

* I Create the following pages: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

* Using Bootstrap, recreate my portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images


Note: The responsive design only deals with the current portfolio project (I designed in the earlier project) as the remaining portifolio projects were done long back.

### Salient features of this project

* The Bootstrap portfolio minimizes the use of media queries.

* Use of Bootstrap's grid system for containers, rows, and columns.

* On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, I designed to have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. (You can have a look to check this feature by visiting various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences, I have designed similarly).

* It is functional and a deployed application on GitHub having the repository with README describing the details of the project.


### Additionally, I worked for a few enhancements on this project

* Using Bootstrap, I made a sticky footer and used sub-rows and sub-columns on my portfolio site.

* Used enough comments for better readability of the code.

* I worked for the possible enhacements using Bootstrap without changing much from my already deployed portfolio design (my previous project)

* The link to the deployed application on GitHub pages [Ratna's Portfolio](https://radeep07.github.io/Portfolio_Ratna/)
