# Portfolio

Building a professional portfolio site using HTML and CSS with the given set of specifications and a style guide.


## User Story

AS A web developer

I WANT a deployed portfolio

SO THAT I can showcase my applications to potential employers and clients


## Business Context

A portfolio is often the first point of contact for employers looking to fill a position or clients in need of a developer to complete a project. A clean and informative portfolio showcases a developer's strongest work and can lead to employment and/or more clients.


## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN that an employer or client wants to hire a developer

WHEN viewing my portfolio

THEN they are able to learn about me, find contact information, and follow links to projects and repositories


## Instructions

* Create a new GitHub repository, initialize it with a `README.md `, and clone it to your local development environment.

  
* Inside the repo folder on my computer, I have created the following:

   * 3 HTML documents: `index.html`, `contact.html`, and `portfolio.html`.

   * A folder called `assets`.

   * Inside the `assets` directory, created two additional folders: `css` and `images`.

     * In the `css` folder, coded a file called `style.css`.

     * In the `images` folder, saved the images I planed to use (like my profile image and the placeholder images for the portfolio).



* When I created a website, it's standard practice to code my HTML files before writing any CSS and to complete one HTML file before moving onto the next. Written HTML semantically too:

   * If something is a heading, used a heading element.
   * If something is a list, used an unordered or ordered list element.

* The content in `index.html` should be unique to me in the following ways:

   * Written a few paragraphs about me to show my personality and strenghs!
   * The main logo with my name displayed. 

* After all my HTML is written, I have begun styling pages using the `style.css` file I created.

   * I have validated html at https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input.
   * Consult the following Style Guide section for advice on styling your CSS files.

## Style i used (a Guide)

* Colors 
   * Teal color (used for headings and backgrounds): `#4aaaa5`
   * Regular font color (used for paragraphs and all text besides the headings): `#777777`
   * Main header background color: `#ffffff`
   * Main header border color: `#cccccc`
   * Footer background color: `#666666`
   * Main content background color: `#ffffff`
   * Main content border color: `#dddddd`

* Fonts:
   * For heading fonts use `font-family: 'Georgia', Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;`
   * For all other fonts use `'Arial', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;`

* Profile image in `index.html`:
   * Used my picture.

* Portfolio images:
   * Saved the images to `images` folder.

* Background images:
   * The background pattern used was found on [Subtle Patterns](https://subtlepatterns.com/). I liked leaves pattern and used it for background.

* Dimensions:
   * The entire content and the main section content area is `960px` wide.

* Made a "sticky footer." Notice that the dark gray footer will always rest just below the content. 
   * Tried to code the footer in a way that it will always remain at the bottom of the page, no matter how short the content is. Refer to this [sticky footer tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/) for guidance.
   * Gave the footer the following CSS: `border-top: 8px solid #4aaaa5;`
